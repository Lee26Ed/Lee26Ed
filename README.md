ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a passionate developer who enjoys solving problems through clean, efficient code. Iâ€™ve worked with a variety of technologies including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, oracleDB, Drizzle ORM, Flask, Oracle APEX, and more. I'm currently working at the Statistical Institue of Belize, where I'm building scalable web applications and learning something new every day.

ðŸ’¡ Fun fact: I genuinely enjoy debuggingâ€”there's nothing more satisfying than tracking down a tricky bug and seeing everything click into place.

Thanks for stopping by!
